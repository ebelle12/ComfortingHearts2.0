        <h1>Meet our Founder</h1>
        <p class="team_desc">
          Angelica Johnson is the Founder of Comforting Hearts Foundation Inc., a faith-based support group dedicated 
          to bringing hope and healing to mothers who have experienced the profound loss of a child. 
        <br>
        <br>
        After enduring the heartbreaking loss of her only son, Allen, Angelica was called by God to turn her pain 
        into purpose. Through Comforting Hearts Foundation Inc., she provides a safe, compassionate space where 
        grieving mothers and families can find solace, encouragement, and the strength to move forward.
        <br>
        <br>
        As a devoted wife, mother, and grandmother, Angelica stands as a testament to God's unfailing love and 
        healing power. She believes that through faith, prayer, and community, broken hearts can be mended. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Her mission is to walk alongside grieving mothers and families, offering spiritual and emotional support 
        while pointing them to the ultimate source of comfort—Jesus Christ. Through her work, she seeks to remind 
        others that even in the darkest moments, God’s grace is sufficient, and healing is possible.
